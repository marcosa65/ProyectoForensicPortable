    "c:\temp\wk1.csv"

* Version 2.00:
  o Added support for decrypting wireless keys from external drive of
    any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP and up to Windows
    10. ('Advanced Options' window - F9)
  o Added 'Advanced external drive settings' option, which allows you
    to choose the Windows protect folder and the Registry hives folder.
  o WirelessKeyView now supports 2 methods for decrypting the

    default method doesn't work on your system, you can choose the other
    one.
  o Added option to view the wireless network of remote computer on
    your network (In 'Advanced Options' window). It only works if you
    have full admin access to the remote computer (Including admin
    shares) and the remote computer has Windows Vista or later. (XP is
    not supported)

* Version 1.76:
  o Added 'Open Filename In Notepad' option (For Windows Vista or
    later).

* Version 1.75:
  o Added 'Filename' column (For Windows Vista or later).

    network name contained '&' or some other characters.

* Version 1.71:
  o Added secondary sorting support: You can now get a secondary
    sorting, by holding down the shift key while clicking the column
    header. Be aware that you only have to hold down the shift key when
    clicking the second/third/fourth column. To sort the first column you
    should not hold down the Shift key.

* Version 1.70:

    previous versions WirelessKeyView displayed them as WPA-PSK keys)
  o The 'Last Modified' column is now also active on Windows XP.

* Version 1.68:
  o Fixed a bug in the 32-bit build without command-line support: On
    Windows 7/8/Vista/2008: WirelessKeyView created a new process of
    WirelessKeyView again and again...

* Version 1.67:
  o Added new build of WirelessKeyView without command-line support.
    In this version, you cannot extract wireless key data without
    displaying the user interface (Which means that /stab, /shtml and
    other export command-line options will not work in this build). The
    advantage of this build: There is a chance that this build will
    trigger less Antivirus alerts, simply because it cannot be used by
    hackers to grab wireless keys stealthily. This build is also compiled
    with different compiler options.
  o Changed the name in the version resource from WirelessKeyView to
    WKV. Strangely, this change reduces the Antivirus alerts
    dramatically, at least for now.

    is now separated from the others. Also, the default answer for the
    delete question is No.

* Version 1.60:
  o WirelessKeyView now uses a new method to grab the wireless keys
    on Windows 7/8/2008: Instead of code injection, WirelessKeyView
    creates a child process that extracts the wireless keys. This means
    that you can use the 32-bit build of WirelessKeyView under Windows
    7/8/2008 64-bit.

* Version 1.56:
  o Fixed issue: The properties and the 'Advanced Options' windows
    opened in the wrong monitor, on multi-monitors system.

* Version 1.55:
  o Added /export and /import command-line options, which allows you
    to export/import wireless keys from command-line.

* Version 1.50:
  o Added export and import feature. You can now select one or more
    wireless keys, export them into a file (with File -> Export Selected
    Items or Ctrl+E) and then import these keys into another computer
    (With File -> Import Keys From Export File or Ctrl+I). Be aware that
    the import feature only works with Windows XP/SP3 or later (including
    Windows 2008/7/Vista). The export feature works on every system
    starting from Windows XP/SP1. Read the 'Export And Import Wireless
    Keys' section for more information about this new feature.
  o Added 3 new columns, only for Windows 7/2008/Vista:
    Authentication, Encryption, Connection Type (ESS for infrastructure
    network, IBSS for ad-hoc network).

* Version 1.36:
  o Fixed bug on Windows 7/2008/Vista: WirelessKeyView truncated the
    key after 32 characters.

* Version 1.35:

    turned on, the odd and even rows are displayed in different color, to
    make it easier to read a single line.
  o Added 'Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File' option. When
    this option is turned on, the column names are added as the first
    line when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.

* Version 1.34:
  o Fixed bug: pressing the delete key in the find window deleted an
    item in the main window.

* Version 1.33:
  o When loading WirelessKeyView under Windows 7 in the first time,
    the 'Code Inject' mode is now turned on by default.

* Version 1.32:
  o Added /codeinject command-line option.

* Version 1.31:
  o Fixed a crash problem with Application Compatibility Engine on
    Windows 7/Vista (only when 'Use code injection method' is turned on).

* Version 1.30:
  o Added 'Use code injection method' option in the Advanced Options
    window, as a workaround for using this utility on Windows 7. (See
    below)

* Version 1.28:
  o Added sorting command-line options.

* Version 1.27:
  o Fixed bug: In Vista, WPA-PSK keys in Ascii form displayed
    additional space character.

    key was not displayed in Ascii form.

* Version 1.25:
  o New and safer method to extract the wireless keys of the local
    machine: In previous versions, WirelessKeyView injected code into
    lsass.exe in order to grab the wireless keys from the system. In rare
    cases, this technique caused a crash inside lsass.exe process.
    Starting from this version, WirelessKeyView uses a new method that
    extract the wireless keys without any code injection.

* Version 1.20:
  o WirelessKeyView now allows you to extract the wireless keys from
    external instance of Windows XP. (In Advanced Options)

Using WirelessKeyView
=====================

WirelessKeyView doesn't require any installation process or additional
DLL files. Just copy the executable file (WirelessKeyView.exe) to any
folder you like, and run it.
After you run it, the main window should displayed all WEP/WPA keys
stored in your computer by Windows 'Wireless Zero Configuration' service.
For WEP keys, the key is also displayed in Ascii form. Be aware that this
utility can only reveal the network keys stored by Windows operating
system. It cannot recover network keys stored by any other third-party
software.



Notice About WPA-PSK Keys
=========================

When you type a WPA-PSK key in Windows XP, the characters that you type
are automatically converted into a new binary key that contains 32 bytes
(64 Hexadecimal digits). This binary key cannot instantly be converted
back to the original key that you typed, but you can still use it for
connecting the wireless network exactly like the original key. In this
case, WirelessKeyView displays this binary key in the Hex key column, but
it doesn't display the original key that you typed.
As opposed to Windows XP, Windows Vista doesn't convert the WPA-PSK Key
that you type into a new binary key, but it simply keep the original key
that you type. So under Windows Vista, the original WPA-PSK key that you
typed is displayed in the Ascii key column.



Registry/File Location of The Stored Keys
=========================================

Windows XP and Windows Vista stores the wireless keys in completely
different locations:
* Windows XP: The wireless keys are stored in the Registry under
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WZCSVC\Parameters\Interfaces\[Inter
  face Guid].
* Windows Vista: The wireless keys are stored in the file system, under
  c:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces\[Interface Guid].
  The encrypted keys are stored in .xml file.



Deleting Wireless Keys Of Old Network Adapters
==============================================

Starting from version 1.15 of WirelessKeyView, you can delete wireless
keys of old network adapters that are no longer plugged to your computer,
by using the 'Delete Selected Items' option.
Be aware that this delete option only works for network adapters that are
not active anymore. If your network adapter is active, use the standard
user interface of Windows to delete the unwanted keys.



Export And Import Wireless Keys
===============================

Starting from version 1.50, you can select one or more wireless keys,
export them into a text file by using the 'Export Selected Items' under
the File menu, and then import these keys into another computer by using
the 'Import Keys From Export File' option.

Before you start using this feature, you should be aware that there are
some problems/limitations:
* The import feature only works on Windows XP with Service Pack 3 or
  later, including Windows 7, Windows 2008, and Windows Vista. You cannot
  use the import feature on Windows XP with Service Pack 1 or Service
  Pack 2. As opposed to the import feature, the export feature works on
  any system, including Windows XP with Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2.
* The import feature on Windows XP/SP3 is very slow, and
  WirelessKeyView may temporary hang during the import process.
* The wireless keys stored inside the export file are not encrypted, so
  if you're concerned about the security of your network, you should keep
  this file in a place where unauthorized users cannot read it, or simply
  delete it after the import process is finished.
* The import feature only works with a text file created with the
  'Export Selected Items' option. You cannot use the import feature with
  the files created by the 'Save Selected Items' option.
* Your wireless network adapter must be active when using the import
  feature. If you have a USB wireless adapter, you must plug it before
  you start the import process.
* If you have multiple wireless network adapters, a separated key entry
  will be added for each adapter.
